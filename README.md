With advancement in computing science, systematic optimization, especially convex optimization, has been recognized as a powerful tool in communication system design, circuit design, efficient signal processing, and other electrical engineering fields. As electrical engineers, especially for graduate students, it is essential to learn basic optimization techniques and apply them in on-going research. In this class, we start with an EE-oriented introduction of convex optimization including convex set, convex functions, convex optimization problems, KKT conditions and duality, unconstrained optimization, and interior-point methods for constrained optimization. We then devote the rest of the class to specific application examples in electrical engineering: communication/information theory, signal processing, circuit design, and networking, which are based on state-of-art research papers.
